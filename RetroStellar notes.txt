# ISSUE BACKLOG

(COMPLETE)Expand Systems	
(COMPLETE)Increase the total number of systems and diversify their attributes to provide space for all empires to grow.

Assign Random Starting Systems
	Assign a unique starting system for each faction, complete with space stations for missions.

Space Station Menu
	Develop a space station menu that includes ship docks, markets, mission hubs, and other player services essential for gameplay.

Economy System
	Implement an economy system where players can buy and sell ship equipment, ships, resources from planets and asteroids, and other items.

Create Equipment System
	Design and create a variety of equipment for ships, such as weapons, shields, engines, and scanners. Modify ship data handling to support modular equipment.

Basic Combat Processes
	Implement combat mechanics, incorporating equipment effects, ship stats, and basic AI for enemy ships.

Experience and Rank Progression System
	Implement an experience system for earning XP through various actions like missions, combat, and resource gathering. Integrate with the existing rank structure.

Skill Training and Research System
	Develop a skill progression and research system that impacts gameplay, such as reducing real-time task durations or improving ship performance.

Real-Time Execution of Activities
	Establish real-time mechanics for activities like mining, repairs, and research, with time reductions through skills.

Missions at Space Stations
	Create a mission generation system that provides faction-specific missions, including combat-related tasks available at space stations.
	Dynamic Mission Generation: Implement a runtime script to dynamically generate missions for space stations, based on predefined templates and randomized elements.

Save and Continue Game Functionality
	Implement the ability to save and load the game state to allow players to continue their progress.

Hazard System
	Implement a hazard system where each system has a hazard level based on its star type (e.g., M-Type stars have low hazards, O-Type stars have high hazards).
	Ship Damage: Ships take damage based on the hazard level of the system, which can be mitigated through specific skills and equipment.

Quest System
	Implement a quest system distinct from station missions that generate reputation, experience points, and drive narrative elements.

Enhance System Connections
	Increase the complexity of system connections with loops and branches for more strategic navigation.

Random Anomalies in Systems
	Introduce anomalies in systems that can impact gameplay, such as resource boosts or hazards.

Basic Storyline or Campaign Mode
	Develop a basic storyline or campaign mode for each faction, adding narrative depth and specific objectives for each faction to accomplish.

Star Menu
	Develop a Star Menu to display information about the star types in each system, detailing their influence on the types of planets and asteroid fields that can be found.

Colonies on Planets
	Implement colonies on planets, allowing players to establish and manage colonies that generate resources over time, including the rare resource of people.
	Resource Generation: Define resource types that colonies can generate, such as minerals, food, and people, with growth over time.
	Colony Management: Include mechanics for managing colony growth, defense, and productivity.
	Narrative Integration: Add narrative elements, quests, and missions related to colonies, including colony establishment, defense, and expansion.

Achievement System
	Implement an achievement system separate from experience and rank progression.
	Track Player Actions: Track actions such as the total number of systems visited, total resources mined, or planets visited.
	Achievement Rewards: Grant special bonuses, additional experience, or other rewards upon reaching milestones.

Event Logging System
	Create an event logging system to track critical game events like anomalies, resource gathering, and mission outcomes for player feedback and debugging.

NPC AI Development
	Develop AI for NPCs to create dynamic and interactive game elements, including faction behaviors, responses to player actions, and autonomous decision-making.

Graphical User Interface Enhancements
	Explore graphical UI improvements using ASCII art and enhanced text formatting to enrich the player's visual experience while maintaining a text-based interface.

Advanced Graphical User Interface Development
	Develop a more advanced graphical user interface to replace the text-based system, incorporating elements like menus, status bars, and interactive text displays.

Settings Menu
    Implement a settings menu to allow players to customize various aspects of the game. Potential options could include:
    Difficulty Levels: Adjust game difficulty to suit player preferences.
    Sound and Music Settings: Enable or disable sound effects and music.
    Display and UI Options: Customize the appearance of the game, including font size, color schemes, or toggle visual effects.
    Control Settings: Remap keyboard controls or adjust sensitivity.
    Gameplay Tweaks: Adjust aspects like resource generation rates, hazard severity, or mission frequency.

System Balancing
	Continuously adjust and balance the game to ensure no faction has an unfair advantage and gameplay remains engaging.

User Interface Adjustments
	Update the UI to accommodate new features, ensuring a smooth and intuitive player experience.

Testing and Debugging
	Regularly test and debug new features to maintain game stability and performance, ensuring a high-quality player experience.

Pygame Integration
