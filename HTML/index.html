            <p>RetroStellar is a retro-style 4x space trading game inspired by classics like TradeWars 2002 and EVE Online.</p> 
            <p>This game arose out of an idea to take advantage of modern-day GPT agents in combination with my own continuing studies in software development.</p> 
            <p>The goal was to quickly stand up a functioning, text-based game in the vein of TradeWars 2002 that was built under a modern codebase and with the assistance of modern GPT agents. TradeWars 2002 originated what EVE Online has evolved. I'm taking the approach of pulling the two together in a text-based UI. TradeWars 2002 and EVE Online are some of my favorite game styles and I tried to bring it to life for you here. Enjoy.</p>
