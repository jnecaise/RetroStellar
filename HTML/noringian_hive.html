            <p>The Noringian Hive is a highly-evolved collective, thriving on the galaxy's most dangerous worlds. With a singular mind and purpose, they expand their influence, assimilating all that comes into their path. Driven by survival and conquest, the Hive’s relentless pursuit of growth strikes fear into those who dare oppose their march across the stars.</p>

            <p><strong>Core Beliefs/Philosophy:</strong> Highlight what drives the faction ideologically (like the Mandate’s theocratic system, or the People of the River's natural philosophy).</p>
            <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> Brief section on key figures or governing structures. Could be a council, emperor, or collective consciousness.</p>
        </section>

            <p><strong>Ships and Fleets:</strong> Present a list or showcase of the ships available to the faction. You already have the JSON for ships, so this can be a nice way to bring it into the website. Include images if possible (even placeholders) and some specs or flavor text for each ship.</p>
        </section>

        </section>
