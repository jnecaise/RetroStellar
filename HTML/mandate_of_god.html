            <p>The Mandate of God is a golden spire of finance, technology, and religion. They believe their leadership communicates with divine beings through AI and advanced technology, but in reality, they are manipulated by an unseen force.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="faction-overview">
            <h2>Faction Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A short, punchy description of the faction’s history, culture, and primary goals. Use what you’ve already written in the JSON for a foundation.</p>
            <p><strong>Core Beliefs/Philosophy:</strong> Highlight what drives the faction ideologically (like the Mandate’s theocratic system, or the People of the River's natural philosophy).</p>
            <p><strong>Leadership:</strong> Brief section on key figures or governing structures. Could be a council, emperor, or collective consciousness.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="gameplay-details">
            <h2>Gameplay Details</h2>

            <p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses:</strong> Outline what this faction excels at (e.g., the Mandate of God having better access to finance and technology) and what they struggle with.</p>
            <p><strong>Special Abilities or Bonuses:</strong> Highlight any unique perks, abilities, or bonuses a player gets for aligning with that faction.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Technology and Ships</h2>
            <p><strong>Faction-Specific Tech:</strong> Describe the type of technology the faction uses. This could be a breakdown of what makes their tech unique, like bio-tech for the Noringian Hive or military-grade weaponry for Shogunate 3072.</p>
            <p><strong>Ships and Fleets:</strong> Present a list or showcase of the ships available to the faction. You already have the JSON for ships, so this can be a nice way to bring it into the website. Include images if possible (even placeholders) and some specs or flavor text for each ship.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="faction-economy">
            <h2>Faction Economy</h2>
            <p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> A breakdown of how the faction generates and uses resources (e.g., The Noringian Hive focusing on dangerous world colonization and extraction).</p>
            <p><strong>Trade & Diplomacy:</strong> Include information on how they interact with other factions or their trade systems. This would be great for gameplay immersion.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Territory & Space Systems</h2>

        </section>
        
        <section id="faction-history">
            <h2>Faction History</h2>
            <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Create a brief timeline of key events, like wars, alliances, or pivotal moments in the faction's past.</p>
            <p><strong>Lore Stories:</strong> Include deeper lore or narrative tidbits that give players more insight into the faction’s background and motivations. You can drip-feed lore bits that relate to the overall game universe here.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="notable-characters">
            <h2>Notable Characters</h2>
            <p><strong>Heroes/Leaders:</strong> A section for legendary figures within the faction, either current leaders or past heroes. You could tie this into the game progression.</p>

        </section>

            <h2>Gallery or Visuals (Optional)</h2>
            <p>Placeholder images, faction colors, logos, and ships can fill out this section. Since you’re adding images for the menu already, extending that here would create visual appeal.</p>
